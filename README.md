# Molten-Fluoride-Inputs
Example input scripts for the simulations reported by Langford et. al. J. Chem. Phys. (2020)


A custom build of LAMMPS with the CONP2 plug-in is required to run these scripts. 
The code and installation instructions can be found at https://github.com/srtee/lammps-USER-CONP2

In addition LAMMPS must be built with the packages MOLECULE, KSPACE, CORESHELL, and DRUDE.

FLiBe_inputs folder contains the input scripts, data file, and tabular potentials required to run 
molecular dynamics of a constant-potential molten FLiBe interface.

FLiNaK_inputs folder contains the input scripts, data file, and tabular potentials required to run 
molecular dynamics of a constant-potential molten FLiNaK interface.
